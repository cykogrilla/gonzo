## Codebase Patterns
- Install script follows chezmoi/Claude Code patterns: POSIX shell, curl/wget support, SHA256 verification
- Binary naming convention: `{name}-{os}-{arch}` (e.g., `gonzo-linux-amd64`)
- Checksums file expected at: `releases/download/{tag}/checksums.txt`
- Color output respects NO_COLOR environment variable

## 2026-02-01 - Enhanced install script with colors and extended platform support

### What was implemented
- Enhanced the existing `install.sh` with additional features inspired by chezmoi and Claude Code install scripts:
  - Added colored output (green for info, blue for debug, yellow for errors, red for critical)
  - Added `-V` flag to display script version
  - Added FreeBSD support (amd64, arm64)
  - Added Windows arm64 support
  - Added checksum format validation (validates 64 hex character SHA256 format)
  - Documented environment variables (BINDIR, NO_COLOR) in help text

### Files changed
- `install.sh` - Enhanced with colors, version flag, extended platform support, and security improvements

### Learnings for future iterations
- The install script already existed and was well-structured following chezmoi patterns
- Color support should check both `-t 1` (is terminal) AND `NO_COLOR` env var
- Checksum validation regex: `^[a-f0-9]{64}$` for SHA256
- Always use `printf` with format string for colored output, not `echo`
- Script syntax can be validated with `sh -n <script>`
